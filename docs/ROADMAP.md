### AvantZero Roadmap

*Current Version: 0.0.0*

This file contains an overview concerning the current development roadmap for the AvantZero algorithm. Please be advised that AvantZero merely serves as a *proof of concept* for the Avant algorithm and will not receive any (major) software updates after the release of its initial version. <br><br>

AvantZero was created as a final submission project for Harvard's CS50X - Introduction to Computer Science Course. Completing this project fulfills the final requirement to be eligible for the CS50 certificate. <br><br>
